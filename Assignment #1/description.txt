First, I put all the XML and PNG files in the same folder called 'data'.

Then, I wrote a Python script to process each XML and PNG pair.

The script first opens the XML file and parses it using the ElementTree library. 

It then checks if the node is a leaf node (i.e., an object) and extracts the bounding box coordinates for each object in the image.

Next, it opens the corresponding PNG image and uses the Pillow library to draw rectangles around the objects based on the coordinates extracted from the XML file.

Finally, it saves the annotated image in the 'output' folder.

I decided to create a new folder called 'output' instead of storing the outputs in the 'data' folder because I think it's good practice to not mix the input and output files.

Also, I added a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the script.

I used the following libraries:
- ElementTree
- Pillow
- os
